      <p>
        I wrote my first line of code (Java) in my first year (2014) in college,
        but my interest in coding started in 2020 because I wanted to build my
        own games and software. I started learning how to code in November,
        2020. I have hands on experience developing websites, full-stack web
        applications and APIs. Currently, I'm learning Java and also improving
        my problem solving skills by learning Data Structures and Algorithm.
