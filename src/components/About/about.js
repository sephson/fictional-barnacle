        Hello! My name is Disu and I enjoy bringing ideas into reality with
        JavaScript. I wrote my first line of code (Java) in my first year (2014)
        in college, but my interest in coding started in 2020 because I wanted
        to build my own games and software. I started learning JavaScript in
        2020. I have hands on experience developing websites, full-stack web
        applications and APIs, I also hold a Bachelo's Degree in Electrical and
        Electronics Engineering.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm excited you're here feel free to reach out to me to me with any
        project ideas you have or to just say hello!
      </p>
    </div>
